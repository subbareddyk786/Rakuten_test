New India Assurance Company Limited is a leading public sector general insurance company in India, owned by the Government of India. Founded by Sir Dorabji Tata in 1919, it was nationalized in 1973. It is a dominant force in the Indian non-life insurance market, known for its extensive network with 1600+ offices across the country. The company has a significant global presence, operating in over 25 countries.

New India Assurance boasts a remarkably diverse product portfolio, extending far beyond conventional offerings. The company provides complex and specialized coverage for large-scale operations, including aviation, marine insurance, or property insurance for large risks. At the other end of the spectrum, it caters to the rural and underserved markets with a range of micro-insurance products, demonstrating a commitment to serving a wide array of customers and their unique needs.

In the fiscal year 2024-25, New India Assurance maintained its position as the largest general insurer in India, with an all-time high gross written premium (GWP) of over ₹43,618 crore and a market share of 12.57%. The company maintains a strong solvency ratio of 1.91x, well above the regulatory requirement, reflecting its financial stability. The company continued its strong performance in Q1 FY26, with a gross written premium (GWP) of ₹13,334 crore, marking a 13.11% year-on-year growth. At the end of Q1 FY26, the company’s market share increased to 15.51% from 14.65% in the same period last year.

The company has consistently received high ratings from major credit agencies, highlighting its financial strength. It holds a 'CRISIL AAA/Stable' rating, the highest possible credit rating, indicating a strong capacity to meet its financial obligations. It also has a 'B++ (Good)' Financial Strength Rating from AM Best.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has consistently identified New India Assurance as a Domestic Systemically Important Insurer (D-SII). This designation is reserved for insurers whose size, market importance, and domestic and global interconnectedness are so significant that their distress or failure could cause a major disruption to the domestic financial system.
